@glock21_name=G21 Pistol

@glock44_name=G44 Pistol
@glock44_desc=A training pistol through and through. I have no clue why you'd want this.

@firearm_mg12ga_name=MG-12GA
@firearm_mg12ga_desc=50 shell belt of 12 gauge buckshot. If you think this is a great weapon for CQB, perhaps the weight and length of the weapon will change your mind.
@firearm_mg762r_name=MG762R
@firearm_mg762r_desc=Some insane person decided to rechamber our M338s into 7.62x54mmR. Don't ask how, don't ask why. Just enjoy the ammo parity.
@firearm_pkp338_name=PKP-338
@firearm_pkp338_desc=SAD decided to rechamber some of it's "legally acquired" Pechenegs into .338 Norma Magnum. How much does it help? I'unno.
